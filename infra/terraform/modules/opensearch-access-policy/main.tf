# Split out from modules/opensearch-serverless deliberately: the data
# access policy's Principal list comes from modules/iam's role outputs, but
# modules/iam needs the collection's ARN as an input (to scope its aoss:*
# IAM statements) - so iam must be created from opensearch-serverless's
# outputs, and this policy must be created from iam's outputs. Combining
# both into one module would be a dependency cycle; see
# environments/*/main.tf for the actual apply order.
