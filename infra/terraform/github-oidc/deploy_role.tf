# --- deploy_role ---------------------------------------------------------
# One role per environment, assumed only by deploy.yml's jobs (which is
# workflow_dispatch-only - see .github/workflows/deploy.yml). Trust
# condition matches `sub = "...:environment:<env>"` exactly. GitHub only
# ever mints a token with an `environment:` claim for a job that explicitly
# declares `environment: <env>` in its YAML - a pull_request-triggered job
# never carries this claim (see plan_role.tf). This means even a
# misconfigured workflow can't get a PR run to assume a deploy role - the
# trust policy itself refuses it, independent of workflow logic or whatever
# GitHub Environment protection-rule settings happen to be configured.
#
# Permissions are scoped by resource-name-prefix ("${var.project}-<env>-*")
# everywhere the target service's ARN format supports it, following the
# exact precedent already established in
# modules/iam/lambda_execution_role.tf's CloudWatchLogsOwnFunctions
# statement - this is what keeps dev/staging/prod isolated from each other
# despite sharing one AWS account (see the project's own "Locked-in
# architecture decisions": isolation is by naming convention + separate
# Terraform state, not separate accounts - a deploy role that ignored this
# convention would quietly undermine that isolation for CI).
#
# A handful of actions are AWS-imposed exceptions that require
# `resources = ["*"]` regardless of scoping intent (ecr:GetAuthorizationToken,
# most OpenSearch Serverless control-plane actions, kms:CreateKey,
# Lambda event-source-mapping actions) - each is called out inline so it
# doesn't read as an oversight. A few S3 Vectors / AgentCore action names
# are best-effort against AWS's published docs and not yet independently
# verified by a real apply - flagged the same way this project already
# flags similar uncertainty elsewhere (see knowledge_base_role.tf's
# S3VectorsDataPlane comment, which documents a real wrong-action-name
# incident found only via a live AccessDenied). Expect to add a missing
# action here if a real `terraform apply` through this role surfaces one.

# Split into three documents (core infra / AgentCore+AI / compute+messaging)
# and attached as customer-managed policies rather than inline ones -
# discovered the hard way, 2026-07-14: AWS's 10,240-byte inline-policy limit
# is an AGGREGATE across ALL inline policies on a single role, not a
# per-document limit (confirmed against AWS's own IAM quotas doc - "the
# total aggregate policy size... per entity can't exceed" 10,240 bytes). A
# first attempt at a 2-way inline split still exceeded that aggregate once
# both documents co-existed on one role (this actually left dev fitting by
# luck, staging partially applied, and prod with NEITHER policy attached -
# a real broken-role incident, not just a plan-time problem). Customer
# managed policies have their own separate 6,144-byte limit that applies
# PER POLICY, not aggregated, and a role can attach up to 10 by default -
# so a 3-way split here has real headroom for the next several rounds of
# real-apply-driven fixes, unlike another inline split would have. No
# permissions or scoping logic changed by this restructure, just how each
