# --- plan_role ---------------------------------------------------------
# Assumed only by pr-validate.yml's tf-plan job, which runs automatically on
# every pull_request - including from this repo's own less-trusted,
# runs-on-every-push context. Read-only by design: AWS managed
# ReadOnlyAccess rather than a hand-rolled read policy, deliberately -
# `terraform plan` needs read access to essentially every resource type this
# project's modules touch, and an incomplete custom read policy would
# silently break `plan` on whatever action got missed (this project has hit
# that exact class of bug before with hand-enumerated IAM actions - see
# modules/iam/knowledge_base_role.tf's S3VectorsDataPlane comment).
# ReadOnlyAccess grants zero mutating actions, so the "a PR can never apply
# anything" safety property holds regardless of how complete the policy is.
#
# Shared across all three environments rather than one role per environment,
# because it's read-only - the blast radius of over-broad read access is
# low, and three near-identical roles would add real maintenance cost for
# no meaningful safety gain on a project this size.
#
# Trust condition matches `sub = "...:pull_request"` exactly (StringEquals,
# not StringLike) - only a token minted for an actual pull_request event can
# assume this role. A token from a manually-dispatched deploy.yml run (which
# carries an `environment:` claim instead, see deploy_role.tf) does not
# match this condition at all.
