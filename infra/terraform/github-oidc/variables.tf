# conditions give no useful error otherwise): GitHub emits
# "repo:OWNER@OWNER_ID/REPO@REPO_ID:..." instead - appending each entity's
# stable numeric ID after an "@", believed to be GitHub's guard against a

# get these two IDs from the GitHub API's `GET /orgs/{org}` (or

# guessing, and re-verify after any future rename or transfer.
