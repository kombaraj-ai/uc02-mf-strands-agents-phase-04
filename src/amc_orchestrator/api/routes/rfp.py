"""RFP submission endpoint - the HTTP equivalent of `cli.py`.

Applies the identical try/except-around-`graph(...)` safety pattern as
`cli.py` (see CLAUDE.md "Bug #2"): Strands node execution is fail-fast, so a
`StructuredOutputException` from `compliance_check` propagates as a raw
Python exception, not a `FAILED` GraphResult. Without this try/except, that
would surface to callers as an unhandled 500 instead of the intended
graceful escalation response.
