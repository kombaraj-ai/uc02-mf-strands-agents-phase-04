"""Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime entrypoint.

Packaged into the container built from the repo-root `Dockerfile` and run via
`uv run uvicorn amc_orchestrator.runtime_entrypoint:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`
(the exact CMD in that Dockerfile) - this is what
`infra/terraform/modules/agentcore-runtime` points `agent_runtime_artifact` at
once an image built from it is pushed to ECR.

Deliberately thin: reuses `workflows.graph_build.build_rfp_graph` and
`workflows.result_extraction.{summarize_result,summarize_exception}` exactly as
`cli.py` and `api/routes/rfp.py` already do - no new translation logic, same
resilience contract (never crash, always a well-formed outcome).

`BedrockAgentCoreApp` implements the HTTP protocol contract AgentCore Runtime
expects: `POST /invocations` (routed to the `@app.entrypoint`-decorated
function below) and `GET /ping` (built in, no code needed here). See
`docs/architecture.md`'s "Phase 02" section and
`infra/terraform/README.md` for the container-image bootstrap flow this
unblocks.
