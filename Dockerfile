# Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime container image.
#
# Must be linux/arm64 - AgentCore Runtime runs on Graviton; this is a hard
# requirement, not a preference (confirmed against Strands' own AgentCore
# deployment guide). Build/push is a manual or CI step, deliberately never
# done by Terraform - see infra/terraform/README.md's "Pass 3" section for
# the exact commands and why.
#
# Build:  docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t <ecr_repository_url>:<tag> .

# Dependencies first for better layer caching - only re-resolved when these
# actually change, not on every source edit. README.md is required here too
# - pyproject.toml declares it as the package readme, and hatchling's build
# backend fails without it even for --no-install-project.

# No `environments/.env.*` file is baked into the image on purpose: Terraform's
# `agent_runtime_artifact` sets real process environment variables directly
# (ENVIRONMENT, DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME, BEDROCK_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID, etc. - see
# infra/terraform/modules/agentcore-runtime), and `Settings` reads those
# without needing an env file to exist at all (see config/settings.py's
# `get_settings()` - a missing env file just falls through to process env vars
# plus field defaults).
