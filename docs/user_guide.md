# User Guide

**AMC RFP & Portfolio Insight Orchestrator — Phase 01 (DEV) + Phase 02 (AWS deployment) + Phase 03 (CI/CD)**

This is the practical, task-oriented companion to [`architecture.md`](architecture.md). It covers
setup, running the system locally three ways (CLI, API, and a Streamlit UI), the mock data you
can query against, troubleshooting, (as of Phase 02) deploying the AWS infrastructure via
Terraform and testing the live, deployed AgentCore Runtime directly - no local server or Ollama
involved at all - and (as of Phase 03) the GitHub Actions pipeline that automates those same
deploy steps. Examples use `uv` and PowerShell, matching this project's actual dev environment
(Windows, `uv`-managed Python).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+, [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed.
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) running locally with `qwen2.5:7b-instruct` pulled:

  ```powershell
  ollama pull qwen2.5:7b-instruct
  ollama list   # confirm it's there
  ollama serve  # if not already running as a service
  ```

  DEV is CPU-only by default here — expect **5-10+ minutes** for a full end-to-end query. This
  is expected, not a hang; see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Setup

```powershell
# From the Phase-01 directory
uv sync

# Optional: copy the example env file if you want to override any default
Copy-Item environments\.env.dev.example environments\.env.dev
```

`environments/.env.dev` is gitignored (even though DEV holds no real secrets — kept consistent
with the STAGING/PROD habit). If it doesn't exist, `Settings` falls back to its built-in
defaults, which are sufficient to run everything in this guide unmodified.

## Configuration reference

Every setting is read through `Settings` (`config/settings.py`), never `os.getenv` directly.
Set any of these as environment variables or in `environments/.env.dev`:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ENVIRONMENT` | `dev` | `dev` \| `staging` \| `prod` — selects which `.env.<environment>` file loads. |
| `MODEL_PROVIDER` | `ollama` | `ollama` \| `bedrock` — which LLM generates responses. Only takes effect in DEV; STAGING/PROD always use Bedrock regardless of this setting. See [Switching model provider](#switching-model-provider-ollama-vs-bedrock) below. |
| `OLLAMA_HOST` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama server address. Used when the effective provider is Ollama. |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL_ID` | `qwen2.5:7b-instruct` | Ollama model. Used when the effective provider is Ollama. |
| `BEDROCK_MODEL_ID` | `anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0` | Bedrock model. Used when the effective provider is Bedrock (always in staging/prod; opt-in in dev). **This default reached end-of-life on Bedrock** (confirmed live, 2026-07-12 - see [Switching model provider](#switching-model-provider-ollama-vs-bedrock)) — override it, e.g. to `amazon.nova-lite-v1:0`, which the deployed dev Runtime now uses. |
| `AWS_REGION` | `us-east-1` | Bedrock region. Used when the effective provider is Bedrock. |
| `DATA_BACKEND` | `local` | `local` \| `aws` — which data layer the quant/qual tools read from. Only takes effect in DEV; STAGING/PROD always use `aws` regardless of this setting (mirrors `MODEL_PROVIDER`/`effective_model_provider`). |
| `DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME` | `""` | DynamoDB table for quant metrics. Populated from Terraform's `dynamodb_table_name` output; used when the effective data backend is `aws`. |
| `BEDROCK_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID` | `""` | Bedrock Knowledge Base for qual commentary retrieval. Populated from Terraform's `knowledge_base_id` output; used when the effective data backend is `aws`. |
| `MODEL_TEMPERATURE_JUDGE` | `0.0` | `compliance_check` temperature. Deterministic as of Phase 04 - a judge doesn't need creative variance. Kept as a correct, no-downside change, but a live A/B on dev (5 runs at 0.15, 5 at 0.0) showed the same ~1-in-5 escalation-after-3-attempts rate either way - `model_temperature_worker` (below) still makes the draft text vary run to run, so this alone doesn't fully eliminate the anomaly. See `CLAUDE.md`'s Phase 04 WS4 entry. |
| `MODEL_TEMPERATURE_WORKER` | `0.2` | `quant_data_pull`/`qual_narrative_pull`/`revise_draft` temperature. |
| `MODEL_TEMPERATURE_SYNTHESIS` | `0.4` | `final_synthesis` temperature. |
| `SQLITE_PATH` | `local_dev.db` | Quant data file (relative to repo root unless absolute). |
| `CHROMA_PERSIST_DIR` | `data/chroma` | Qual vector store directory. |
| `CHROMA_COLLECTION_NAME` | `fund_manager_commentary` | Chroma collection name. |
| `MAX_COMPLIANCE_ATTEMPTS` | `3` | Graceful cap on `compliance_check` re-runs before forced escalation. |
| `COMPLIANCE_STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | `3` | Retries *within one* `compliance_check` call on `StructuredOutputException` — separate from the above, see [architecture.md](architecture.md#known-limitation-structuredoutputexception-on-compliance_check). |
| `GRAPH_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `300` | `GraphBuilder.set_execution_timeout()` — **seconds**, not ms. |
| `GRAPH_MAX_NODE_EXECUTIONS` | `12` | Hard safety-net node-execution ceiling; should never actually fire. |
| `API_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Uvicorn bind host. |
| `API_PORT` | `8000` | Uvicorn bind port. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `*` | Comma-separated allowed origins. `*` is fine for localhost-only DEV; restrict in staging/prod. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `DEBUG` | Standard logging level name. |
| `LOG_FORMAT` | `json` | `json` (machine-readable) or `console` (human-friendly). `cli.py` forces `console` automatically in dev. |

## Switching model provider (Ollama vs. Bedrock)

DEV defaults to Ollama - free, fully local, no setup beyond [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) - but
some use cases (long prompts, tighter latency needs, evaluating output quality) benefit from a
faster, more capable model. Rather than requiring a separate STAGING environment for that, DEV
can opt into Bedrock per-run via `MODEL_PROVIDER`, with zero code changes - see
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md#model-provider-abstraction) for how the resolution logic
works.

**To use Bedrock from DEV:**

1. Have AWS credentials available in your environment (e.g. `aws configure`, an SSO profile via
   `aws sso login`, or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` env vars) with Bedrock invoke
   permissions for the model you choose, in the target region.
2. Set in `environments/.env.dev` (or as process env vars):

   ```powershell
   $env:MODEL_PROVIDER = "bedrock"
   $env:BEDROCK_MODEL_ID = "amazon.nova-lite-v1:0"  # or another Bedrock model you have access to
   $env:AWS_REGION = "us-east-1"
   ```

   `anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0` (the code default) reached end-of-life on Bedrock -
   confirmed live, 2026-07-12, when a real invocation returned `ResourceNotFoundException`. Check
   `aws bedrock list-foundation-models --by-provider anthropic` (or the equivalent console page)
   for what's currently `ACTIVE` in your account/region before picking a model. Note that
   current-generation Anthropic models require a cross-region **inference profile** ID (e.g.
   `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5`), not a plain on-demand model ID, which also needs extra IAM
   permissions (see `infra/terraform/environments/dev/locals.tf`'s `bedrock_model_arns` comment if
   you go that route) - `amazon.nova-lite-v1:0` avoids that complexity by supporting on-demand
   invocation directly, and is sufficient for this project's structured-output need (Strands'
   `BedrockModel.structured_output` only ever requests `tool_choice={"any": {}}`, which Nova
   supports).

3. Run the CLI or API exactly as before - no other change needed:

   ```powershell
   uv run python -m amc_orchestrator.cli "Please provide the current risk metrics for the Fixed Income Core Bond Fund (INC2) and its current macroeconomic strategy."
   ```

**Trade-offs to know before flipping this on:**

- **Real cost, even from DEV.** Every agent turn is a billed Bedrock invocation. This is not a
  free local sandbox anymore once `MODEL_PROVIDER=bedrock` is set.
- **The `StructuredOutputException` flakiness on `compliance_check` (see
  [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)) is an Ollama-specific limitation** - Bedrock's Claude
  models support real `tool_choice` forcing, so this specific failure mode is expected to be
  much rarer with `MODEL_PROVIDER=bedrock`.
- `GET /health/ready` automatically stops checking Ollama reachability once Bedrock is the
  active provider (checked via `effective_model_provider`, not just `ENVIRONMENT`) - it isn't
  meaningful to ping a local port that isn't being used.
- STAGING/PROD always use Bedrock regardless of `MODEL_PROVIDER` - that setting only ever
  changes behavior in DEV.

**Confirmed working**: see
[`sample_invocation_walkthrough.md`](sample_invocation_walkthrough.md) for a full node-by-node
trace of a real `MODEL_PROVIDER=bedrock` run - completed in 11.64 seconds end-to-end (vs. 5-10+
minutes on Ollama for the equivalent query), with the compliance agent invoking its
structured-output tool natively on the first try.

## Mock fund data (DEV)

Four funds are seeded automatically (idempotent — safe to re-run) the first time you run the CLI
or start the API:

| Ticker | Name | Category | NAV | Alpha | Beta | Sharpe | Std Dev | Sortino | R² | 1Y Return | 3Y Return |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EQG1` | Global Equity Growth Fund | Largecap | 145.20 | 1.20 | 1.05 | 1.15 | 14.20% | 1.45 | 0.92 | 15.4% | 12.1% |
| `SMC3` | Alpha Prime Smallcap Direct Fund | Smallcap | 88.40 | 4.50 | 1.35 | 1.30 | 22.80% | 1.68 | 0.78 | 28.6% | 18.4% |
| `INC2` | Fixed Income Core Bond Fund | Debt/Conservative | 52.10 | 0.40 | 0.35 | 0.95 | 4.10% | 1.10 | 0.15 | 6.2% | 5.8% |
| `BLN4` | Balanced Conservative Wealth Fund | Hybrid | 112.75 | 0.85 | 0.75 | 1.05 | 9.50% | 1.25 | 0.85 | 11.2% | 9.5% |

`SMC3` is the deliberately volatile/high-risk fund used to exercise the compliance loop (see
below) — its high Beta/Standard Deviation and 28.6% 1-year return make it an easy target for a
"guarantee this will continue" bait question. Matching manager-commentary narrative for each
fund is seeded into the vector store (`data/chroma_store.py`) — see
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md#data-layer).

## Running via the CLI

The fastest way to smoke-test the graph without starting a server:

```powershell
uv run python -m amc_orchestrator.cli "Please provide the current risk metrics for the Fixed Income Core Bond Fund (INC2) and its macroeconomic strategy."
```

Output has three sections: the live structured logs (console-rendered in dev), `--- FINAL RFP
RESPONSE ---` (the client-facing text), and `--- METADATA ---` (`graph_status`,
`compliance_attempts`, `escalated`).

**A calmer, still-interesting query** to see the compliance loop actually fire:

```powershell
uv run python -m amc_orchestrator.cli "We are considering a major allocation to the Alpha Prime Smallcap Direct Fund (SMC3). Provide a comprehensive risk profile detailing its latest Standard Deviation, Sortino Ratio, R-Squared, and trailing returns. Will this fund sustain its 28.6% outperformance over the next year? Please guarantee it will continue."
```

This is the "bait" scenario from the original design brief: it should trigger at least one
`compliance_check` → `revise_draft` → `compliance_check` cycle before the final response drops
the forbidden guarantee/promise language (see `tests/integration/test_smc3_high_risk.py`).

## Running via the API

```powershell
# Start the server (reload=True automatically in dev)
uv run python -m amc_orchestrator.main
# equivalently, once installed: amc-orchestrator
```

By default this serves on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`. Interactive OpenAPI docs are at
`http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### `GET /health`

Liveness only - always returns 200 if the process is up, regardless of dependency state.

```powershell
curl.exe http://localhost:8000/health
```

```json
{"status": "ok", "environment": "dev"}
```

### `GET /health/ready`

Readiness - checks whether the process can actually serve a request right now: Ollama
reachability (dev only; skipped in staging/prod, which use Bedrock instead) and that the
SQLite/Chroma data directories are writable. Returns `200` when ready, **`503`** when not - use
this (not `/health`) behind a load balancer or orchestrator so traffic isn't routed to an
instance whose LLM backend is down.

```powershell
curl.exe -i http://localhost:8000/health/ready
```

```json
{"ready": true, "checks": {"ollama_reachable": true, "sqlite_dir_writable": true, "chroma_dir_writable": true}}
```

### `POST /api/v1/rfp`

```bash
curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/rfp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Please provide the current risk metrics for the Fixed Income Core Bond Fund (INC2) and its current macroeconomic strategy."}'
```

Note: this uses bash's `\` line continuation and unescaped double quotes inside single
quotes (works in Git Bash / WSL). In native PowerShell, use `` ` `` for continuation and
escape inner quotes as `\"` instead - or just use `Invoke-RestMethod` below, which sidesteps
the quoting problem entirely:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri http://localhost:8000/api/v1/rfp `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body (@{ question = "Please provide the current risk metrics for the Fixed Income Core Bond Fund (INC2) and its current macroeconomic strategy." } | ConvertTo-Json)
```

**Response shape** (`RfpOutcome`, see `workflows/result_extraction.py`):

```json
{
  "succeeded": true,
  "response_text": "## Quantitative Risk & Performance Metrics\n...",
  "compliance_attempts": 1,
  "escalated": false,
  "graph_status": "completed"
}
```

`succeeded: false` / `escalated: true` means the safe escalation path fired — either the
compliance loop exhausted `MAX_COMPLIANCE_ATTEMPTS` still REJECTED, or the graph raised an
exception outright (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)). In both cases `response_text` is
always the exact `ESCALATION_HOLDING_MESSAGE` text — never partial or improvised content. This
is a 200 response either way, by design: an escalation is a valid, well-formed outcome, not a
server error. A request only ever returns a non-2xx status for genuine client errors (e.g. an
empty `question` → `422`).

A ready-to-import request collection (health/readiness checks + both scenarios above) is at
[`postman/amc_orchestrator.postman_collection.json`](postman/amc_orchestrator.postman_collection.json).

## Running via the Streamlit UI

A browser front-end with **two connection modes**, chosen via a sidebar "Target" radio:

- **Local API server** — a thin HTTP client over `POST /api/v1/rfp`, no separate agent logic, the
  same way `cli.py` is. Requires the API server already running (see
  [Running via the API](#running-via-the-api) first; the UI has nothing to talk to otherwise).
- **Deployed AgentCore Runtime (AWS)** — calls the real, deployed Phase 02 Runtime directly via
  `boto3`'s `invoke_agent_runtime` (SigV4-signed), with **no local server or Ollama involved at
  all**. This is a genuine alternative to the boto3 script / AWS Console methods in
  [Testing the deployed AgentCore Runtime](#testing-the-deployed-agentcore-runtime-phase-02) below
  — added after this guide originally shipped, so if you've used this UI before and remember it
  being local-only, that's now out of date.

Both modes return the identical `RfpOutcome` JSON shape, so the result view below behaves
identically regardless of which one produced it.

```powershell
# One-time: pull in the UI's extra dependencies (Streamlit, on top of the base install)
uv sync --group ui

# Terminal 1 - only needed for Local API server mode
uv run python -m amc_orchestrator.main

# Terminal 2 - the UI (works standalone in Runtime mode, no Terminal 1 needed)
uv run streamlit run src/amc_orchestrator/ui/streamlit_app.py
```

Opens at `http://localhost:8501`. What's in it:

- **Sidebar — Local API server mode**: API base URL (defaults to `http://localhost:8000`,
  editable if you're pointed at a different host/port), a live API-online / readiness badge (calls
  `/health` and `/health/ready`, same semantics as [above](#get-healthready)).
- **Sidebar — Deployed AgentCore Runtime mode**: AWS region and Agent Runtime ARN fields (the ARN
  is pass 3's `terraform output agent_runtime_arn`), a live "Runtime READY" status badge (calls
  `bedrock-agentcore-control`'s `get_agent_runtime`), and a reminder that it uses whatever AWS
  credentials are already active in your environment (`aws configure`, an SSO login, etc.) — the
  same ones used for `terraform apply`, no separate login step.
- **Sidebar — both modes**: a request-timeout slider (raise this past the default 600s if you're
  on Ollama and a query is genuinely still running — see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting);
  Runtime-mode and Bedrock-backed local queries typically finish in well under a minute), and the
  mock fund reference table.
- **Sidebar — Admin: Upload KB documents** (collapsed expander, independent of connection mode —
  it's a plain S3 action, not an RFP call): a bucket-name field, a multi-file uploader, and
  **Upload to S3** / **List documents in bucket** buttons that call S3 `PutObject`/
  `ListObjectsV2` directly, using the same active AWS credentials as Runtime mode. Lets you seed
  Knowledge Base commentary docs without leaving the UI or dropping to the CLI — no manual
  ingestion call needed afterward, the auto-sync pipeline (see
  [Enabling the Knowledge Base and ingesting documents](#enabling-the-knowledge-base-and-ingesting-documents-pass-2-in-full)
  below) picks it up within its ~5 minute batching window.
- **Main panel** — a dropdown of example queries (one per mock fund, including the SMC3
  high-risk/compliance-loop scenario), an editable question box, and a **Submit RFP** button.
- **Result view** — an Approved/Escalated status badge, compliance-attempt count, elapsed time,
  the rendered response text, and the raw `RfpOutcome` JSON in a collapsible expander.
- **Session history** — every query submitted in the current browser session, newest first, so
  you can compare outcomes across runs without re-submitting.

No graph-failure handling is needed in the UI itself — both the API route and the Runtime
entrypoint already guarantee a well-formed `RfpOutcome` on every call, escalation included (see
[`POST /api/v1/rfp`](#post-apiv1rfp) above). The UI only surfaces connection-level failures
(API unreachable, request timeout, missing/invalid AWS credentials, wrong region/ARN) as
user-facing error messages — distinct exception handling per mode (`httpx.ConnectError`/
`TimeoutException` for Local; `ClientError`/`BotoCoreError` for Runtime).

**Confirmed working end-to-end via the actual browser UI**, not just `boto3` directly: Playwright
driving headless Chromium against the real running app confirmed the mode switch reveals the right
fields, entering a real deployed Runtime ARN shows a genuine "Runtime READY" badge, and submitting
the INC2 example query in Runtime mode returns a real synthesized report (Approved, 1 compliance
attempt, 8.3s) rendered correctly through the same result view used by Local mode.

## Running the tests

```powershell
# Fast, deterministic, no LLM required — should always be green
uv run pytest tests/unit -q

# Slow (30-45+ min combined across all 4 scenarios), needs Ollama reachable;
# auto-skips per-test if it isn't
uv run pytest tests/integration -m integration -q
```

The integration suite covers four end-to-end scenarios against a real Ollama instance: a
low-risk completion, the SMC3 compliance-loop trigger, a forced single-attempt escalation proof
(`MAX_COMPLIANCE_ATTEMPTS=1`), and an unseeded-ticker honesty check — see
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md) and each test's module docstring for what specifically each
one proves.

## Deploying to AWS (Phase 02)

Phase 02 provisions the AWS infrastructure for running this system on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
(Runtime, Gateway, Memory, DynamoDB, a Bedrock Knowledge Base backed by either OpenSearch
Serverless or Amazon S3 Vectors, Lambda, IAM) via modular Terraform, one root module per
environment, plus (as of the app-code follow-on task) an AgentCore-compliant entrypoint, a
DynamoDB/Bedrock-Knowledge-Base data-layer swap, and a `Dockerfile` to actually build the image
the Runtime needs.

Full instructions, the three-pass apply flow, and known gotchas (why `PUBLIC` network mode is
required, why the vector index needs a second pass, the settings mapping the entrypoint now
consumes) live in [`infra/terraform/README.md`](../infra/terraform/README.md) — this
section is just the map, not the territory:

```powershell
# One-time, per AWS account: the Terraform state backend
cd infra/terraform/bootstrap
terraform init; terraform apply

# Per environment (dev/staging/prod), pass 1 of 3 - see the README for passes 2 and 3
cd ../environments/dev
cp backend.hcl.example backend.hcl   # fill in from bootstrap's output
terraform init -backend-config="backend.hcl"
terraform apply
```

Requires Terraform v1.15.7, AWS credentials for the target account, and Bedrock model access
already granted for the chosen model/embedding model (an account-level opt-in, not something
Terraform provisions). See [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md)'s "Phase 02" section for the locked-in
architecture decisions (network mode, database choice, auth model) and why each one was made.

**What Pass 1 actually creates** (everything with no not-yet-existing prerequisite): IAM roles
for the Runtime/Gateway/Lambda-execution/Knowledge-Base (4 roles + policies), the DynamoDB
quant-metrics table, the (empty) ECR repo, the S3 docs bucket, AgentCore Memory + a semantic
strategy, the AgentCore Gateway + one target per Lambda tool, the stub tool Lambdas + their log
groups, and CloudWatch observability (log groups, alarms, a dashboard) — and, **only when
`vector_store_backend = "opensearch"`** (staging/prod always; dev's default), the OpenSearch
Serverless collection and its access/encryption/network policies. With dev's actual current
setting (`vector_store_backend = "s3_vectors"`), **none of the OpenSearch resources are created
at all** — see [`infra/terraform/README.md`](../infra/terraform/README.md#pass-1--everything-that-doesnt-depend-on-a-not-yet-existing-artifact)
for the authoritative, always-current version of this list (module-by-module, kept in sync with
the actual Terraform).

**Re-provisioning dev after a full teardown — read before your first `terraform apply`.** If
dev was previously fully torn down (`terraform state list` empty), check
`environments/dev/terraform.tfvars` before applying: it may still have `enable_knowledge_base`
and `enable_agent_runtime` left set to `true` from before the teardown, plus a
`container_image_uri` referencing an image tag that no longer exists (deleted along with
everything else). Since state is empty, a single `terraform apply` in that state would attempt
**all three passes at once** — including the Agent Runtime referencing a container image that
doesn't exist yet in the freshly-recreated, empty ECR repo — and fail partway through pass 3.
Either:
- Temporarily set `enable_agent_runtime = false` for the first apply (the safe, originally-designed
  incremental flow — pass 1, then pass 2, then flip back to `true` for pass 3 once a fresh image
  is actually pushed), or
- Build and push a fresh image to the ECR URL *before* applying, if you're confident of the
  target URL: it's deterministic (`<account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<name_prefix>-agent-runtime`,
  from `modules/ecr`), so the existing `container_image_uri` string in `terraform.tfvars` is
  likely still correct — but the repo itself doesn't exist until pass 1 creates it, so a
  `docker push` will fail until then. Simplest sequencing:
  1. `terraform apply -target=module.ecr` (creates just the ECR repo).
  2. `docker build`/`push` a fresh image to that URL (see
     [Building and pushing the container image](#building-and-pushing-the-container-image-pass-3)
     below).
  3. Full `terraform apply` (all three passes, since the flags are already `true` and the image
     now exists).

`enable_knowledge_base = true` is lower-risk to leave as-is — pass 2 no longer needs the AOSS
community-provider dance at all if `vector_store_backend = "s3_vectors"` (dev's current setting,
see below), so there's no equivalent "resource doesn't exist yet" trap for that flag.

### Testing the AgentCore Runtime entrypoint locally (no Docker/AWS needed)

`runtime_entrypoint.py` implements the exact HTTP contract AgentCore Runtime expects, so you can
smoke-test it as a plain local process before ever building an image:

```powershell
uv run python -m uvicorn amc_orchestrator.runtime_entrypoint:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8099
```

Then, in another terminal:

```powershell
curl http://127.0.0.1:8099/ping
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8099/invocations -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{\"prompt\": \"Please provide the current risk metrics for the Fixed Income Core Bond Fund (INC2) and its macroeconomic strategy.\"}'
```

Uses whatever `Settings.effective_data_backend` resolves to just like the CLI/API do — `local`
(SQLite/Chroma) by default in DEV, or `aws` (DynamoDB/Knowledge Base) if you've set
`DATA_BACKEND=aws` plus `DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME`/`BEDROCK_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID` from Phase 02's
Terraform outputs.

### Building and pushing the container image (pass 3)

```powershell
docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t <ecr_repository_url>:v1 .
aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <ecr_repository_url>
docker push <ecr_repository_url>:v1
```

Must be `linux/arm64` — AgentCore Runtime runs on Graviton, not optional. `<ecr_repository_url>`
is pass 1's `ecr_repository_url` Terraform output. Once pushed, set
`enable_agent_runtime = true` and `container_image_uri` in `terraform.tfvars` and apply — see
`infra/terraform/README.md`'s "Pass 3" section.

**Confirmed working end to end against real AWS, 2026-07-12** (dev environment) — all three
passes applied, the Runtime is `READY`, and a real `invoke_agent_runtime` call returns a genuine
APPROVED, synthesized report. See [Testing the deployed AgentCore Runtime](#testing-the-deployed-agentcore-runtime-phase-02)
below for exactly how, and `CLAUDE.md`'s "Phase 02" section for the three real deploy bugs found
and fixed along the way (a Dockerfile fix, a `MODEL_PROVIDER` fix, and the model end-of-life fix
mentioned above) — useful background if your own deploy hits the same symptoms.

### Enabling the Knowledge Base and ingesting documents (pass 2, in full)

Pass 2 (`enable_knowledge_base = true` + apply) creates the vector index, an empty Knowledge
Base, **and** an auto-sync pipeline (`modules/kb-ingestion-sync` — S3 event → SQS → Lambda →
`start-ingestion-job`, see [`architecture.md`](architecture.md#auto-sync-ingestion-s3-events-to-bedrock-knowledge-base)
for the design) — all as part of this same pass, no extra flag needed. That pipeline only
*reacts* to bucket changes, though: Terraform never uploads a document itself, so **the first
time** a document needs to exist in the Knowledge Base at all, someone still has to put it in the
S3 docs bucket (steps 1–2 below). Once it's there, every future upload or deletion re-syncs the
Knowledge Base automatically within a few minutes — no manual `start-ingestion-job` call needed
for that part. Steps 3–5 below (look up the data source ID, trigger the job, poll it) are now
**optional** — keep them for testing when you don't want to wait out the batching window, or if
the CloudWatch alarm on the sync pipeline's DLQ (`<name_prefix>-kb-ingestion-dlq-depth`) fires and
you want to see the state without digging through Lambda logs first.

**Which vector store backs the Knowledge Base is controlled by `vector_store_backend`**
(`environments/<env>/variables.tf`, default `"opensearch"`):

- `"opensearch"` (default; the *only* option in `staging`/`prod` — set anything else there and
  `terraform plan` fails with a validation error) — Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, via
  `modules/opensearch-index` and the `opensearch-project/opensearch` community provider. Needs
  `additional_data_access_principals` set first (see below).
- `"s3_vectors"` (**dev-only**) — Amazon S3 Vectors, the cheapest vector store Bedrock Knowledge
  Base supports, via the new `modules/s3-vectors` (a native `hashicorp/aws` resource — no
  community provider, no `additional_data_access_principals` step needed for this piece).
  `environments/dev/terraform.tfvars` already sets `vector_store_backend = "s3_vectors"` — that's
  a `terraform.tfvars` override, not the variable's own `default` (which stays `"opensearch"` in
  all three environments, dev included, as a safe fallback — see `variables.tf`). **This backend
  creates zero OpenSearch resources at all** — the collection itself and its access policy are
  skipped too, for full cost savings, not just the vector-index/Knowledge-Base-storage piece. See
  [`architecture.md`](architecture.md#dev-only-vector-store-choice-opensearch-serverless-vs-s3-vectors)
  for the full design.

Document ingestion below is identical regardless of which backend is selected — it uploads to the
same S3 docs bucket either way, and the Knowledge Base itself abstracts away whether the
resulting vectors land in OpenSearch or S3 Vectors. Terraform only ever creates an *empty*
Knowledge Base and never uploads a document itself, so steps 1–2 below (getting a document into
S3 the first time) are always manual. Steps 3–5 (looking up the data source ID, triggering the
job, polling it) are the *initial* ingestion for that first upload — after that, the auto-sync
pipeline handles every subsequent change on its own, so you generally only walk through the full
five steps once per document.

**(opensearch backend only) Before this pass**: add your own applier ARN to
`additional_data_access_principals` in `terraform.tfvars` (see README's Pass 2 section), then
`terraform apply` to create the vector index + empty Knowledge Base. The `s3_vectors` backend
doesn't need this step at all.

#### Step 1 — Get the source documents as real files

The Knowledge Base's data source only ever reads from S3 — it can't ingest a Python string
directly. The mock-fund commentary text used to seed the local Chroma store in DEV
(`data/chroma_store.py`'s `_MOCK_COMMENTARY` list) is already checked into the repo as standalone
`.txt` files under [`docs/mock-data/`](mock-data/) (`doc_eqg1.txt`, `doc_smc3.txt`, `doc_inc2.txt`,
`doc_bln4.txt`), copied verbatim from that list — nothing to generate yourself.

#### Step 2 — Upload each file to the Knowledge Base's S3 docs bucket

This is the bucket `modules/s3-kb-docs` created back in Pass 1 — its real name is a Terraform
output, not something you choose or hardcode:

```powershell
$bucket = terraform output -raw kb_docs_bucket_name   # e.g. amc-orchestrator-dev-kb-docs-766354255780
aws s3 cp ..\..\docs\mock-data\ s3://$bucket/ --recursive --exclude "*" --include "doc_*.txt"
```

(Adjust the relative path if you're not running this from `infra/terraform/environments/<env>/` —
`docs/mock-data/` is at the repo root.)

Alternatively, the Streamlit UI's sidebar **Admin: Upload KB documents** panel (see
[Running via the Streamlit UI](#running-via-the-streamlit-ui) above) does the same `PutObject`
call per file through a browser file picker — useful if you'd rather not leave the UI.

At this point the files exist in S3, and the auto-sync pipeline (`modules/kb-ingestion-sync`) has
already queued a `start-ingestion-job` call in the background — it fires within
`maximum_batching_window_seconds` (default 5 minutes) of the upload with no further action from
you. If you don't want to wait, or want to see a job ID and poll it yourself right now, steps 3–5
below trigger the exact same operation manually and immediately (harmless to run even if the
automatic sync also fires around the same time — Bedrock just treats the second call as a
`ConflictException`, which both paths already handle gracefully).

#### Step 3 — Look up the data source ID

`start-ingestion-job` (next step) needs both a `knowledge-base-id` (a Terraform output:
`knowledge_base_id`) *and* a `data-source-id`, which is **not** a Terraform output —
`modules/knowledge-base` creates exactly one data source per Knowledge Base, but AWS only assigns
its ID at creation time, so you look it up rather than compute it:

```powershell
$kbId = terraform output -raw knowledge_base_id
aws bedrock-agent list-data-sources --knowledge-base-id $kbId
# copy the "dataSourceId" value from the JSON output, e.g. "5LFXDA9A5K"
```

#### Step 4 — Trigger the ingestion job (optional — the auto-sync pipeline does this for you)

This is the step that actually does the work: Bedrock reads every object currently in the S3 docs
bucket, splits each one into chunks (per `modules/knowledge-base`'s `chunking_max_tokens`/
`chunking_overlap_percentage` settings, defaults 512/20%), calls the embedding model (Titan V2 by
default) on each chunk, and writes the resulting vectors into whichever backend
`vector_store_backend` selected. It's **asynchronous** — this call only *starts* the job and
returns immediately, it doesn't wait for it to finish:

```powershell
$dataSourceId = "<paste the dataSourceId from step 3>"
aws bedrock-agent start-ingestion-job --knowledge-base-id $kbId --data-source-id $dataSourceId
# copy the "ingestionJobId" value from the JSON output, e.g. "WEF8FEIYNO"
```

#### Step 5 — Poll until it finishes

A job moves through `STARTING` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `COMPLETE` (or `FAILED`) — there's no webhook or
notification, so you have to poll it yourself. For 4 small text files this typically completes in
well under a minute:

```powershell
$jobId = "<paste the ingestionJobId from step 4>"
do {
  Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
  $job = aws bedrock-agent get-ingestion-job --knowledge-base-id $kbId --data-source-id $dataSourceId --ingestion-job-id $jobId | ConvertFrom-Json
  Write-Host $job.ingestionJob.status
} while ($job.ingestionJob.status -notin @("COMPLETE", "FAILED"))
$job.ingestionJob.statistics   # numberOfDocumentsScanned / numberOfNewDocumentsIndexed / numberOfDocumentsFailed
```

`numberOfDocumentsFailed` should be `0`. If it isn't, the individual document errors aren't in
this response — check the Knowledge Base's ingestion job details in the Bedrock console for the
per-document failure reason.

**Confirmed working, dev, 2026-07-12**: all 4 mock-fund commentary texts uploaded and ingested
exactly via steps 1–5 above — `numberOfDocumentsScanned: 4, numberOfNewDocumentsIndexed: 4,
numberOfDocumentsFailed: 0`, confirmed complete on the very first 5-second poll (that run predates
[`docs/mock-data/`](mock-data/) existing as checked-in files — it copy-pasted the text out of
`data/chroma_store.py`'s `_MOCK_COMMENTARY` list by hand; both are the same source text). See
`CLAUDE.md`'s "Phase 02" section for the full session log.

**Auto-sync pipeline (`modules/kb-ingestion-sync`, added 2026-07-13) is now applied to real AWS and
field-verified end-to-end, 2026-07-13** — the "no manual step needed after the first upload" claim
above is confirmed real behavior now, not just intent. Verified via a full round trip with no
manual `start-ingestion-job` call made for any of it: uploading a file triggered an ingestion job
automatically within the batching window (`numberOfNewDocumentsIndexed: 1`), deleting that file
triggered another job that correctly removed its vector (`numberOfDocumentsDeleted: 1`, confirmed
absent from a subsequent `bedrock-agent-runtime retrieve` call), and re-uploading it restored the
vector (`numberOfNewDocumentsIndexed: 1` again). Full step-by-step trace and evidence:
[`sample_invocation_walkthrough.md`](sample_invocation_walkthrough.md)'s "S3 Auto Sync - Inner
working" section.

### Testing the deployed AgentCore Runtime (Phase 02)

Once pass 3 is applied and the image is pushed, the Runtime is a real, invokable AWS resource —
independent of anything on your local machine (no Ollama, no local server). Three ways to test it
— the Streamlit UI's **Deployed AgentCore Runtime (AWS)** mode (see
[Running via the Streamlit UI](#running-via-the-streamlit-ui) above) is the quickest for
interactive testing; the two scripted options below are what was used to verify dev:

**Python/boto3** (what was used to verify dev):

```python
import boto3, json

client = boto3.client("bedrock-agentcore", region_name="us-east-1")
resp = client.invoke_agent_runtime(
    agentRuntimeArn="<agent_runtime_arn>",  # pass 3's Terraform output
    payload=json.dumps({"prompt": "Please provide the current risk metrics for the Fixed Income Core Bond Fund (INC2) and its macroeconomic strategy."}).encode("utf-8"),
    contentType="application/json",
)
print(resp["response"].read().decode("utf-8"))
```

Requires your AWS credentials (the same ones used for `terraform apply`) and `boto3` — no other
setup, and no Ollama/local server involved at all.

**AWS Console**: Bedrock console → AgentCore → Runtimes → your runtime → **Test** tab has a
built-in invocation UI, no code needed.

The AWS CLI installed in this project's dev environment is too old to have `bedrock-agentcore`
commands — use one of the two methods above instead unless you upgrade it.

**Confirmed working for all 4 mock funds against real AWS, 2026-07-12** (dev, post document
ingestion) — same `invoke_agent_runtime` call, one query per fund (`"What are the current risk
metrics for <fund name> (<ticker>), and what is the manager strategy commentary behind its risk
profile?"`):

| Fund | Result | `compliance_attempts` | Wall time |
|------|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| EQG1 (Equity Growth) | APPROVED | 1 | 6.9s |
| SMC3 (Smallcap, high-risk) | APPROVED | 2 | 11.7s |
| INC2 (Fixed Income) | APPROVED | 3 | 11.6s |
| BLN4 (Balanced) | APPROVED | 3 | 13.5s |

All four returned `succeeded=true, escalated=false, graph_status=completed` with real DynamoDB
quant metrics correctly matched to the right ticker and real Knowledge-Base-retrieved commentary
grounded together, no fabrication — at 7-14 seconds per query, versus Ollama's 5-10+ *minute*
baseline for the equivalent local query (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)).

### Tearing an environment down

```powershell
cd infra/terraform/environments/dev   # or staging / prod
terraform destroy
```

**If the environment has actually been used** (a pushed ECR image, ingested Knowledge Base
documents, ingested OpenSearch vector documents), `terraform destroy` may hit AWS's and the
OpenSearch community provider's standard "won't delete non-empty resources" safety checks on
three resources: the ECR repo, the S3 docs bucket, and the `opensearch_index`. `modules/ecr`,
`modules/s3-kb-docs`, and `modules/opensearch-index` all now set the relevant force-delete flag
(`force_delete`/`force_destroy = true`), so a **fresh** environment's first-ever destroy should
not hit this at all.

If you're destroying an environment that was already partway torn down with an *older* version of
those modules (before the force-delete flags existed in state), a plain `terraform apply` at that
point is dangerous — it can **recreate** everything already destroyed if `enable_agent_runtime`/
`enable_knowledge_base` are still `true` in `terraform.tfvars`. In that situation, clear the
blocking content directly via AWS APIs instead, then re-run `destroy`:

```powershell
# ECR — delete pushed image digests
aws ecr batch-delete-image --repository-name <ecr_repository_name> --image-ids imageDigest=<digest>

# S3 (versioning is on — delete_object alone isn't enough) — delete every object version
aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket <kb_docs_bucket_name>
aws s3api delete-object --bucket <kb_docs_bucket_name> --key <key> --version-id <version_id>

# OpenSearch Serverless index — AOSS's REST surface is limited (no _delete_by_query/_search
# without extra setup); a direct SigV4-signed DELETE on the index path works
curl -X DELETE "https://<collection_endpoint>/kb-default-index" ...  # SigV4-signed
```

See [`architecture.md`](architecture.md#environment-lifecycle-teardown-and-cost-control) for the
full account of why this happened once on dev and how it was resolved. After clearing content
(or on a fresh environment), `terraform destroy` should report `0 added, 0 changed, N destroyed`
with nothing left behind — confirm with `terraform state list` (empty output means the environment
is fully torn down; a fresh `terraform apply`, all three passes, is required before using it
again).

## CI/CD (Phase 03)

Phase 03 automates the manual `terraform apply`/`docker build`/`docker push` commands above via
two GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/pr-validate.yml`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
and a new Terraform root module for CI's own AWS identity (`infra/terraform/github-oidc/`). Full
one-time setup steps and the staging/prod first-rollout sequence live in
[`ci_cd_runbook.md`](ci_cd_runbook.md) — this section is just the map, not the territory. See
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md#phase-03--cicd-github-actions) for the design and why.

**One-time setup** (before either workflow can do anything beyond `pr-validate.yml`'s
no-credentials jobs):

```powershell
cd infra/terraform/github-oidc
cp backend.hcl.example backend.hcl
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars   # fill in your real github_org/github_repo
terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl
terraform apply
terraform output deploy_role_arns
terraform output plan_role_arn
```

Then create the three GitHub Environments (`dev`/`staging`/`prod`, restricted to the `main`
branch) and set the repo-level and per-Environment variables those outputs feed — exact steps in
[`ci_cd_runbook.md`](ci_cd_runbook.md).

**On every pull request to `main`**, `pr-validate.yml` runs automatically — lint, type check, unit
tests, a Docker build sanity check, and (for Terraform changes) `terraform fmt`/`validate` plus a
`terraform plan` posted as a PR comment. Nothing here ever touches AWS beyond that read-only plan.

**To actually deploy**, dispatch `deploy.yml` manually — GitHub UI (Actions tab → Deploy → Run
workflow) or:

```powershell
gh workflow run deploy.yml -f environment=dev
# staging/prod also need image_tag - an already dev-built git-SHA tag to promote:
gh workflow run deploy.yml -f environment=staging -f image_tag=<sha> -f promote_image=true
```

Nothing auto-deploys on merge, for any environment, including dev — every deploy is an explicit,
deliberate action. Staging/prod deliberately have no required-reviewer approval gate either (see
[`ci_cd_runbook.md`](ci_cd_runbook.md) for why - it would deadlock a single-maintainer setup) - the
manual trigger itself, plus the OIDC role scoping, is the safety net.

## Troubleshooting

**A query is taking a long time. Is it stuck?**
Not necessarily. On CPU-only Ollama, a single agent turn can take 60-140 seconds, and a full
low-risk query (quant+qual in parallel, then compliance, then synthesis) can take 5-10+ minutes.
The SMC3 high-risk scenario needs at least two `compliance_check` passes plus a `revise_draft`
cycle, so budget more like 15-20 minutes for that one. Check `ollama ps` and the timestamps in
the structured logs before concluding something has actually hung.

**I got the escalation message (`"This request requires manual compliance review..."`) instead
of a real report.**
This is a known, intentional safety behavior, not necessarily a bug — it means the compliance
loop either genuinely couldn't approve the draft within `MAX_COMPLIANCE_ATTEMPTS`, or
`qwen2.5:7b-instruct` failed to invoke its structured-output tool on `compliance_check` even
after an internal retry. The latter is a **known DEV-only limitation**: Ollama's Strands model
integration doesn't support `tool_choice`, so Strands' "force the structured output tool"
mechanism is a no-op on this stack (full root-cause writeup in
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md#known-limitation-structuredoutputexception-on-compliance_check)).
It is expected to be far rarer against Bedrock in STAGING/PROD. If you need a deterministic
success for a demo, retry the same query — the retry itself is stateless per attempt.

**`ollama list` doesn't show `qwen2.5:7b-instruct`.**
`ollama pull qwen2.5:7b-instruct` (≈4.7GB download, one-time).

**First Chroma query is slow / downloading something.**
The first run downloads the default `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` ONNX embedding model (~80MB) used for
vector search. One-time cost; cached locally afterward.

**Integration tests are being skipped.**
They auto-skip (not fail) if Ollama isn't reachable at `Settings.ollama_host` — this is
intentional so the fast unit suite (and `pr-validate.yml`'s `unit-tests` job, which only ever runs
`tests/unit`) never depends on a local LLM being up. Start Ollama and re-run if you want them to
actually execute.
