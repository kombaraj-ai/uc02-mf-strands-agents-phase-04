"""M10 hardening: a nonexistent fund ticker must be handled honestly, not crash.

`get_fund_performance` (`tools/quant_tools.py`) already has a deterministic
unit-level proof that it returns an error payload for an unknown ticker
(`tests/unit/test_tools.py::test_get_fund_performance_unknown_ticker_returns_error_payload`).
This test is the end-to-end complement: does the whole graph - agent
reasoning included, not just the tool wrapper - stay resilient and honest
when asked about a fund that was never seeded, rather than silently
fabricating numbers for it or crashing the graph.
