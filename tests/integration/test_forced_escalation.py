"""M10 hardening: prove the graceful-termination layer actually fires.

`workflows/routing.py` has isolated unit-level proof (`tests/unit/test_routing.py`)
that `needs_revision`/`ready_to_synthesize` force a route to `final_synthesis`
once `MAX_COMPLIANCE_ATTEMPTS` is hit, even against a fabricated REJECTED
state. This test is the end-to-end complement: a real graph, a real LLM, and
the SMC3 "guarantee it will continue" bait question - the same one
`test_smc3_high_risk.py` uses to prove the revision loop *does* fire with the
default budget - but with `MAX_COMPLIANCE_ATTEMPTS` forced to 1, so there is
no budget left for even a single `revise_draft` cycle. This proves the system
never lets a REJECTED draft escape as if it were compliant just because the
attempt budget ran out - the one behavior that must never silently degrade.
