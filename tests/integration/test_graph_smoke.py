"""End-to-end smoke test of the full RFP graph against real local Ollama.

A calm, low-risk query should complete in COMPLETED status with a compliant
disclaimer, ideally without needing more than one compliance pass. It
cannot be asserted to *always* reach that outcome in DEV, though - see the
try/except below.
